\section{Problem}\label{sec:problemdef}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce the problem setting in more detail than in the introduction and formally define the problem and what exactly we aim to solve in this paper.\\
\item show where exactly the proposed cache is located in an online \spath service providers system.
\item State goal 1(a) and 2(b)
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reduce the time spent executing the \spath algorithm. - The \spath algorithm is usually the single most CPU expensive task at a \spath service provider.
	\item Reduce the time spent on overhead. - Introducing a cache will also add some overhead, this overhead not desirable and should  be minimized.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Introduce the overall setting which our solution work in and give a table of notation for reader reference.
\end{enumerate}
