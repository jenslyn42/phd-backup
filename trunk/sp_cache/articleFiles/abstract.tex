% All the papers either solve the problem of a more efficient cache in a specific domain, or use the network domain,  which are both relevant, but not really useful when looking at shortest path caching.

% The papers show some interesting ways to use cache, but ultimately their approaches are very domain or query specific so their approaches to caching and cache replacement/invalidation can not be applied directly.


short description of what we do, why this is an interesting/challenging problem, and how well we solve the problem (key results, mention theoretical guaranties.)
