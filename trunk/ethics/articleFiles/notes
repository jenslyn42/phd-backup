Notes:

remove sec. 1.1 
	Add running example to paper.

Section 2:
	Rewrite motivation for more fluent reading.

Section 3: 
	Quite short, try to fix references.
	Expand on the parts we claim and maybe provide the reference from our own experiements.
	
Section 3.1
	Better start of section, it should have an intro before describing the figure of the architecture.

Maybe switch 4.1 and 4.2, and in 4.2 move the info about simplest method closer to beginning.
