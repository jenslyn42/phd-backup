Images are commonly used as a medium to assist in learning, effective advertising, and capture precious moments in life. Providing good image compression is very important, because it can save storage space and provide faster transmission over low bandwidth networks. Depth channel is a new idea for image processing. From the Microsoft Kinect, the RGBD images can be obtained. Some research on depth channel application, for example, to use the depth channel for the 3D image construction, has been done by other researchers. Since the properties of the depth channel are different from the RGB images, study on the compression method for depth channel is meaningful to do. This report studies whether compression is efficient on images which include a depth channel. In our experimental study we use the DCT Transform and Wavelet Transform.
