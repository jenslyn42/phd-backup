\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:future}

After having implemented and compared the Wavelet transform and DCT transform to no compression and Matlabs build in JPEG encoding we can safely say that it makes sense to compress images which includes depth information. As seen in the experimental results in table \ref{tab:compressionratio}, it is however important to choose suitable algorithms for both the RGB and depth channel. It should be obvious that RGB and depth information exhibit different characteristics, we have however managed to actually prove it in the experimental section.
