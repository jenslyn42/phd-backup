All the papers either solve the problem of a more efficient cache in a specific domain, or use the network domain,  which are both relevant, but not really useful when looking at shortest path caching.

The papers show some interesting ways to use cache, but ultimately their approaches are very domain or query specific so their approaces to caching and cache replacement/invalidation can not be applied directly.
