\section{Eksperiments}
To enable us to better argue about the real performance, as well as the strong and weak points of our ideas, we use a gaussian distribution model for the queries together with a graph with 6100/7035 vertices/edges.

\ffh{intro of section and what will be presented, and in which order}

\ffh{brifly mention the implementation}

\ffh{if possible find a baseline to compair with.}


\subsection{Data Generation}

\ffh{explain the Brinkhoff data generator, the facts about the Oldenburg map and the generator parameters}

\ffh{if time is used in the experiments, mention hardware it was run on}


\subsection{Test Parameters}
\ffh{state all the parameters which will be used and make clear which will be held static unless otherwise stated in the experiments section}




\subsection{Eksperiments}

\ffh{Write some test, generate graphs of them, explain graphs}

\ffh{explain why we have choosen the tests we have}
