% \frametitle{Anonymizers are not Necessary}
% Private Queries in Location Based Services: Anonymizers are not Necessary.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Proposes a framework to support private location-dependent queries.
% \item Does not require an anonymizer, since it's a single point of attack.
% \item Uses cryptographic techniques to ensure privacy.
% \item Communication and CPU intense, because of encryption.
% \end{itemize}

% \frametitle{Buddy Tracking}
% Buddy tracking - efficient proximity detection among mobile friends.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Proposes a centralized server and a peer-to-peer method for tracking friends.
% \item Using the strips on the peer-to-peer algorithm - ensures privacy and reduces communication cost.
% \item Using a quadtree algorithm for the centralized algorithm.
% \item Still lot of communication using the peer-to-peer algorithm.
% \item Centralized server algorithm.has a lot of overhead and is outperformed when lots of users has joined the service.
% \item Privacy is not discussed in this article.
% \end{itemize}
