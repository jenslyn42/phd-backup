%General
%
%    * Is it clear where the paper was published and by whom?
%    * Does the talk have a concrete motivating example very early?
%    * Are unfamiliar abbreviations introduced and used appropriately?
%    * Is the main problem addressed in the paper clearly stated?
%    * Does the presentation have concrete and minimal examples of core ideas?
%    * Are dynamics, e.g., searching a tree presented using animation techniques?
%    * Are the listeners background use appropriately, e.g., no need to tell what an array is, however must tell what the XY++-Tree is?
%    * Is there a reasonable number of slides in total in the presentation?
%
%Figures
%
%    * Are complicated figures presented in sufficient details?
%    * Are the symbols used in the figures clear to the listeners?
%
%Performance Graphs
%
%    * Is data, queries, modification, and transactions appropriately introduced?
%    * Are the axis on performance graphs clearly explained?
%    * Are the main conclusion from the graph clearly stated?
%    * Is there only one graph per slide (or are graphs compared)?
%
%Critique
%
%    * Is the critique relevant and fair?
%    * Is the critique balanced?
%    * Is the critique points concrete, i.e., not "it is a good paper"?
