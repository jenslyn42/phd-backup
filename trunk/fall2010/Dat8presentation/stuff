The application is compiled to Javascript. Also included is an AJAX library and 
widget set [2] that provides access to the DOM model of modern javascript-capable 
web browsers. The AJAX library and the widget set library are a hybrid mix of 
Python and Javascript. Just as with GWT, "Pyjamas is not its libraries", and 
neither is it "yet another AJAX framework". AJAX Frameworks are strictly limited 
to providing pre-prepared specific functionality, written almost exclusively in 
tailor-made Javascript. Both GWT and Pyjamas, being Javascript compilers, allow 
the developer to work in the language with which they are familiar (Java or Python, 
respectively), to write their own custom widgets, either entirely from scratch 
or based on the existing available widgets, yet still target the full range of 
modern browers. So, far from presenting web developers with a fait-accomplit 
AJAX Framework, Pyjamas gives you the freedom to develop your own.
