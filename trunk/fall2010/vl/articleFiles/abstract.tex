The privacy-aware proximity detection service determines if two
users, e.g., friends, vehicles, etc., are close to each other
without requiring them to disclose their exact locations. Existing proposals of such
service provide weak privacy, low precision guarantees, or lack of flexibility
for user settings. 

In this work, we combine the best features of existing proposals
and build our client-server solution for proximity detection based on encrypted
partitions of the spatial domain. Our service notifies a user if any
pre-selected users enters his specified "area of interest", his Vicinity
Region. Unlike in other proposals, our solution supports irregular-shaped,
dynamically-changeable vicinity regions, which enables various proximity
detection scenarios not supported by existing solutions.

It offers strong user location privacy where the server evaluates
proximity queries blindly without manipulating the spatial data
of any user. Experimental results show that our solution, being
equipped with a new set of features, performs well compared to
existing solutions.
