\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we develop the \vl, a client-server solution for detecting
proximity by inclusion of one user's location inside another user's vicinity, 
while offering users control over both location privacy and precision of 
proximity detection.

The client maps its location into a granule and finds all granules contained 
in his vicinity, which can be shaped arbitrarily. The client
then encrypts its location- and vicinity- granules and sends them to the server
which checks for proximity by checking for inclusion of $u_1$'s location granule
in the set of $u_2$'s vicinity granules. The server does the test blindly, without ever
knowing anything about user locations.

Experimental results showed that \vl performs adequate for real world application
and it is scalable to high number of users.  Our presented optimization
techniques worked very well and in some cases cut the amount of data transferred by
approximately 90\%. Experiments showed, that \vl' features such
as irregular shaped vicinities and adjustable precision do not give significant
overhead in terms of communication when compared with the \ff. Note, that the
\ff has none of the mentioned features.

In the future, we plan to explore the possibility to apply our approach on a 
road network such that user's vicinity is defined by all paths accessible from his 
current location within reach of $d$ meters.
